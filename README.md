In total there are 14 attribute columns with 43 weapon rows, leaving a total of 473 entries into the Dataset  
  
### Objective:
My objective was to clean and prepare the Data due to the raw data being very unorganised.  
I then moved on to finding insights about the data and elaborate them in the form of visualisations to demonstrate my key findings.  
  
I have visualised:  
- Distribution of Damage values, showing how frequently different damage values  
- Distribution of weapon rarities  
- Relationship between 'Damage' and 'Fire Rate'  
- A Scatterplot matrix to identify patterns, correlations, and potential insights in the data
